# Trajectory-collison
This code detects collison between multiline trajectories. It can take any size of trajectries.
Here a trajectory is a collection of points or connected segments.
The class trajectory allows the user to create different sizes of trajectories.
Moreover the compare trajectories method inside the class can be used to find intersections.
This method can detect more than one interesctions if there are any.
